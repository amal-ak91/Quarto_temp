# Global Literacy Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the project **"Unlocking Potential: A Global Journey Through Literacy"**.  
This project analyzes literacy trends, disparities, and insights across the world using real-world data and interactive analytics.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to:
- Explore global literacy rates and their growth over time.
- Identify gender and regional disparities in literacy.
- Visualize insights using clear, accessible graphics and interactive dashboards.

## Data Sources

The analysis uses two main external data files:
1. **UNICEF Literacy Dataset**: Provides country-wise annual literacy rates.
2. **UNICEF Literacy Methodologies**: Details the methodologies used for measuring literacy globally.

Both datasets were downloaded from the [UNICEF Data Portal](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/literacy-rate/).

## Files & Extensions

- **.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- **.qmd**: Quarto Markdown file for reproducible reporting and HTML export.
- **.html**: Published report, viewable as a web page (generated from the Quarto file).
- **README.md**: This file, providing project documentation and context.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas, plotnine, matplotlib, geopandas**: For wrangling and visualization.
- **Quarto**: For converting notebooks/markdown into a polished HTML report.

## How to Use

1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook for step-by-step code and outputs.
3. View `index.html` or the Quarto-generated HTML file for a formatted report.
4. See this README for context and navigation.
